# Web Scraping and Document Similarity Using Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF, and SimHash

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

1. **Scrape Content from a Website**: Extract textual data from a specified website using web scraping techniques.
2. **Calculate Document Similarity**: Compare the similarity between documents using the **Cosine Similarity**, **TF-IDF**, and **SimHash** metrics. These methods leverage vectorized representations and hashing to analyze the relationships between text data.

### Key Features:

* **Web Scraping**: Uses Python from scratch to parse and extract meaningful text from the website.
* **Text Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned by removing stopwords and tokenizing the content before analysis.
* **Cosine Similarity**: Computes how similar two documents are by comparing their vectorized term frequency representations.
* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Enhances the representation of documents by considering the relative importance of terms in a document versus their frequency in the entire dataset.
* **SimHash**: Implements a hashing technique to generate fingerprint-like representations of documents for fast similarity detection.

### Use Cases:

* **Scraping Content**: Extract and analyze articles, blog posts, or other textual content from websites.
* **Document Similarity**: Compare textual data to evaluate how similar different documents are based on their content.
* **Efficient Comparison**: Use SimHash for faster and approximate similarity detection in large-scale datasets.
* **Weighted Analysis**: Leverage TF-IDF to prioritize unique terms in similarity calculations.

### Methods Overview:

1. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors representing the documents.
   - Effective for determining the similarity based on term frequencies.

2. **TF-IDF**:
   - Calculates the importance of words in a document relative to the dataset.
   - Adjusts term frequency by penalizing commonly occurring words across documents.

3. **SimHash**:
   - A locality-sensitive hashing algorithm that generates compact fingerprints for documents.
   - Ideal for approximate similarity detection across large datasets.
